- Time-Travel Adventure: game that involves time travel. Players could solve puzzles in different time periods of time to affect the present or future.(things gonna mess up so player will have to solve the problems while solveing problems he creates more problems)

Game mechanics:
-

Time travel function:

Player would need to kill Alien bosses to fill a gauge (which would not be so easy)

by using the gauge player can travel trough time 

Past,Present or Future

by using one full gauge player can travel

-if in present: to both future or past

-if in past: only to present

-if in future: only to present

the gauge will also be used to power up weapons with some temporary buffs
(which definitely wouldn't require a full gauge)

**PLAYER CAN ONLY TRAVEL THROUGH TIME THROUGH MIRRIORS**
